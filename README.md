## Overview
The goals of this project is to utilize the UART lines on E key M.2 conbnectors to make serial ports. There are plans to have multiple types of serial ports. Currently the [RPI UART standard](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/debug/debug-connector-specification.pdf) has been mostly implemented and an RS-232 header is currently being developed. If you have a specific connector you want please make a feature request in the issues section.
